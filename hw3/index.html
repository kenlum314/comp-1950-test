            <h2>Places I Have Visited</h2>
            <p>
                Here are two places I have visited: Edmonton, Alberta and San Francisco, California. I lived in the
                former for three months back in <time>2002</time> for a summer job, while the latter I visited four
                times between <time>1990</time> and <time>2014</time>.</p>
            <p>
                In the brief profiles below, I will compare each city to Vancouver:

                    <h3>Edmonton, Alberta</h3>
                    <p>
                        Edmonton is a relatively modern city, with some new neighbourhoods
                        entirely comprised of new houses, something not found in Vancouver.
                        One of its major tourist attractions is the West Edmonton Mall (one
                        of the largest malls in the world). Aside from the latter, I wasn't
                        able to explore other tourist attractions as I was there to work:-(
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My favourite part about Edmonton is its roads. They are wide and afford drivers
                        great visibility. Where we see stop signs in Metro Vancouver, Edmonton has yield
                        signs, so there is no legal requirement to come to a complete stop. Truth be told,
                        everyone in Vancouver treats the stop signs as yield signs anyhow; but in Edmonton, it
                        is legal to do so!

                <article class="column-right">
                    <h3>San Francisco, California</h3>
                    <p>
                        With relatives in San Francisco, I visited the city several times as a
                        tourist. San Francisco is older than Vancouver and has very hilly terrain.
                        A notable characteristic of San Francisco lies in its residential neighbourhoods,
                        which primarily consist of row houses&mdash;houses which are in physical contact with
                        each other along their adjacent walls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My favourite part about San Francisco is that its climate reminds me of what I wished Vancouver's
                        would be. The weather is essentially a warmer, foggier, and less rainy version of Vancouver weather.

            <h2>HTML5 Features</h2>
            <p>
                Two new HTML5 tags I have used on this page that were not demonstrated in class are the <code>time</code> and <code>summary</code> tags.

                <!--Unlike the above 'column-left' and 'column-right' 'article' elements, the corresponding elements here
                have instead been semantically marked as sections as they refer to other parts of this page and therefore

                    <h3>The <code>time</code> Tag</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The <code>time</code> tag surrounds the years listed in the introduction of the previous section
                            (invoke your browser's element inspector on the years to see the markup). The purpose of the
                            <code>time</code> tag is to semantically mark content as <em>human-readable</em> temporal information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <code>time</code> tag has one specific attribute, <code>datetime</code>, which is used to define
                            <em>machine-readable</em> temporal information (e.g. <code>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2015-03-14 00:00&quot;&gt;Start
                            of Pi Day 2015&lt;/time&gt;</code>).

                                <em>Remarks</em>: The <code>time</code> tag currently isn't rendered in a manner that makes
                                it visually distinct from its surrounding text.

                        <li>
                            The <code>summary</code> tag is used to give a title to (or <em>summarize</em>) the contents of the
                            <code>details</code> tag. The <code>summary</code> tag must be used as a child of the
                            <code>details</code> tag (and should be the <em>first</em> child tag). A <code>summary</code> tag can be seen at the bottom of this page, providing
                            a title to the hidden assignment <em>details</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <code>summary</code> tag has no specific attributes.

                                <em>Remark A</em>: Without the HTML5 Shiv, the <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code>
                                tags, along with all other HTML5-specific tags, do <em>not</em> get styled properly in IE 8
                                and below. With the Shiv, the <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> tags still don't
                                function properly in those versions of IE, but at least they style reasonably.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Remark B</em>: In the browsers that are not compatible with the <code>details</code>
                                and <code>summary</code> tags, the accordion widget is not present, but all the content
                                (including the normally hidden content) is still visible and readable.

                            Note: The <code>details</code> tag is meant to give additional information in an accordion-like widget
                            that can be opened or closed by the user.
